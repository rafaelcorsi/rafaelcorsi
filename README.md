### Aboutme üëã

- Faculty @ Insper (2016 - ...)
- Visiting scholar @ UIUC (2023)
- PhD in progress @ Unicamp/IC (2022 - ...)

I am a faculty member at [Insper](https://insper.edu.br) where I teach digital systems to undergraduate students in computer engineering and computer science. This includes instruction on topics such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), microcontrollers, and Embedded Linux:

- [Bits and Processors](https://insper.github.io/bits-e-proc/) 
- [The Elements of Computer System](https://insper.github.io/Z01.1/) 
- [Embedded systems](https://insper.github.io/ComputacaoEmbarcada/)
- [SoC and Embedded Linux](https://insper.github.io/Embarcados-Avancados/)

I also work on developing new tools and ideas to assist faculty in implementing student-centered classes. Some of these tools can be found in the Insper Education GitHub organization at https://github.com/insper-education/. This is also the theme of my PhD at the Instituto de Computa√ß√£o of Unicamp supervised by [Rodolfo Azevedo](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~rodolfo/).

‚≠ê You must see this tool that allows faculty to publish course material with and get telemetry from it:

- https://insper-education.github.io/active-handout/
  
It is current in use by several courses at Insper and is an enfort of [toshikurauchi](https://github.com/toshikurauchi) and [igordsm](https://github.com/igordsm).

## On go research

1. There is a research project between Insper and UIUC involving me, Igor from Insper, and Mariana and Craig from UIUC. The project focuses on adapting immediate feedback and frequent testing to project-based courses and open-ended projects.
    - The first idea we will try is to incorporate continuous feedback into our weekly activities and measure its impact on our projects.
    - I am currently analyzing (git logs, github issues and student interactions, static analysis, questionnaire) of the two past semesters to identify the most common errors. Based on this analysis, I am thinking about how to implement interventions in 2023-2
    
1. Writing a paper to the FIE 2023 about the impact of HDL languages in introductory computer architecture courses.

3. Developing a web tool to assist faculty in analyzing the Git logs of students in GitHub Classroom.

### Miscellaneous (technical)

Most from the time that I worked at the NSEE laboratory at [Maua](https://maua.br) were I was developing an [EGSE for the ESA Plato](https://plato-project.iaa.es/node/17) project and working with aerospace electronics systems.
